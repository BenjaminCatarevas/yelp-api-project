# Yelp API Project

This project uses Yelp's Fusion API to recommend users restaurants and any other type of store based on preferences. These preferences include:
* Type of restaurant/store
* How many results
* Location
* Radius to search

It also includes Google Maps to show where the stores are in relation to your current location.
